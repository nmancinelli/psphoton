# psphoton
Monte Carlo simulation of elastic-wave scattering processes in Earth's interior.

This code was originally written by Peter Shearer in 2002-2004. It was updated by
Nicholas Mancinelli and Wei Wang in 2012-2018.  This version is currently
optimized to tackle teleseismic phases, but alternate codes for local and regional
problems are currently in development.

This repository contains the source code for psphoton as well as an example
postprocessing script.

The bash file compiles the executable, runs psphoton, and postprocesses/plots the output.
